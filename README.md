# EPAI3_Session6- First Class Functions

Write a single expression that includes lambda, zip, and map functions to select create 52 cards in a deck - 50 pts
Write a normal function without using lambda, zip, and map function to create 52 cards in a deck - 50 pts
Write a function that, when given 2 sets of 3 or 4 or 5 cards (1 game can only have 3 cards with each player or 4 cards or 5 cards per player) (1 deck of cards only), (2 players only), can identify who won the game of poker (Links to an external site.)! - 100 pts
Basics (applicable to 2/3 above):

The proper readme file that explains all the tests that you are writing - 50 (if not there then 0)
Docstrings are a must, and it must mention what the function is doing (2, 3) - 25pts
Write annotations for 3 - 25 pts
Basics tests to ensure your code is correct (20+ combination tests (counted as 1 test) in 3, check 1/2 with a manual list of 52 cards. Overall 20 tests at minimum) - 200 pts
Import your python file/functions to a notebook, and then SHOW all the functions working as intended. This notebook file is the first file that we'll check to see your results. So if this file is missing, or a particular function/feature is not mentioned here, you'll lose marks.
